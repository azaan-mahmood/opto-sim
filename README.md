## opto-sim: A Physics-Based Optical Simulation Framework for QKD Systems

opto-sim is a modular Python simulation engine for modeling real-world optical components in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems ‚Äî particularly the BB84 protocol. It focuses on numerical simulation, Stokes vector polarization modeling, and physically accurate component behavior (phase modulators, lasers, APDs, fiber, etc.).

‚öôÔ∏è Built as a backend simulation framework, not a GUI ‚Äî with emphasis on modular design, physics fidelity, and scientific interpretability. This aligns with R&D workflows in tools like HFSS, Lumerical, or SIwave.

**Work in Progress**  
This project is under active development and not production-ready, but reflects:

- A strong interest in engineering simulation
- Hands-on application of numerical methods to physical systems
- A backend-first approach suitable for scripting, automation, and scientific use

## Project Overview

This simulator aims to mimic the behavior of physical optical components used in QKD experiments‚Äîspecifically BB84 protocol setups‚Äîthrough mathematical models. It‚Äôs intended as a learning tool and experimental platform for simulating realistic noise conditions, signal degradation, and quantum encoding/decoding via optics.

### Current Features

- **Laser Source**  
  - Solid-state lasers modeled after Nd:YAG and Er:YAG systems.

- **Phase Modulators**  
  - Supports X-cut and Y-cut, Z-propagating configurations.

- **Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs)**  
  - Models include shot noise, thermal noise, and random Gaussian/Poisson noise.

- **Optical Components**  
  - Basic tools like beam splitters, couplers, etc

- **Visualization**  
  - Polarimetry
  - Calculation of **Stokes parameters** for polarization state analysis.
  - Poincare Sphere

- **Fiber Cable**
  - Simulates fiber transmission, optional dispersion modeling

### Mathematical Modeling

All models aim to closely reflect published experimental setups and component behaviors found in academic literature. While accuracy is a priority, simplifications are made when necessary to keep computations tractable.

## Technical Highlights
- Physics-first architecture: Built from experimental papers and known equations
- Modular backend API: Easily compose system-level simulations
- Pure Python + NumPy stack
- Runs in Jupyter/Colab with reproducible outputs and examples
- Output includes:
  - Stokes vector breakdown
  - Cosine similarity across transmission
  - Realistic phase and polarization transitions

## Sample Use Case
### Code
```python
from src.opto_eq import PhaseModulator
from src.lasers import sslaser as laser
from src.viewers.stokes import compute_stokes_parameters
from src.viewers import polarimeter
source = laser.SolidStateLaser(
    wavelength=1550e-9,  # Laser wavelength
    polarization_azimuth=np.pi,  # 45¬∞ polarization
    polarization_ellipticity=np.pi/4,
    power_dbm=-5,  # arbitrary power unit
    frequency=5e6
)
E_field = source.get_electric_field(normalize=False, over_period=True)
S0, S1, S2, S3 = compute_stokes_parameters(E_field)
print(f"S0 = {S0:.3f}\nS1 = {S1:.3f}\nS2 = {S2:.3f}\nS3 = {S3:.3f}")
polarimeter(E_field, title=f"Laser Output")
pm = PhaseModulator(crystal_cut='X', modulation='DC')
E_modulated = pm.modulate(E_field, V=3.3)
S0, S1, S2, S3 = compute_stokes_parameters(E_modulated)
print(f"S0 = {S0:.3f}\nS1 = {S1:.3f}\nS2 = {S2:.3f}\nS3 = {S3:.3f}")
polarimeter(E_modulated, title=f"Phase Modulator Output")
